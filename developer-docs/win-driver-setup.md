## Windows Driver Setup

In order to support isochronous USB transfer on Windows, you will need to install drivers for the cameras in your Pupil headset. 

<aside class="notice">
  The driver installation is done automatically when you run the Pupil Capture or Service bundle. Do not manually install drivers if you dont run Pupil from source!
</aside>

### Download drivers and tools
1. Download and install [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
1. Download and extract [Pupil camera driver installer](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0Byap58sXjMVfR0p4eW5KcXpfQjg)

### Install drivers for your Pupil headset

1. Navigate to `pupil_labs_camera_drivers_windows_x64` directory
1. Double click *`InstallDriver.exe`* - this will install drivers. Follow on screen prompts. 
1. Open `Windows Device Manager` from `System > Device Manager`. Verify the drivers are correctly installed in `Windows Device Manager`. Your Pupil headset cameras should be listed under a new category titled: `libusbK Usb Devices`. Note: In some cases `Pupil Cam1` may show three of the same `ID` as the camera name. Don't worry - just make sure that the number of devices are the same as the number of cameras on your Pupil headset.
1. Download the latest release of Pupil software and launch `pupil_capture.exe` to verify all cameras are accessible.

### Troubleshooting

If you had tried to install drivers with previous driver install instructions and failed, or are not able to access cameras in Pupil Capture. Please try the following:

1. In `Device Manager` (`System > Device Manager`)
1. `View > Show Hidden Devices` 
1. Expand `libUSBK Usb Devices`
1. For each device listed (even hidden devices) click `Uninstall` and check the box agreeing to `Delete the driver software for this device` and press `OK`
1. Repeat for each device in libUSBK Usb Devices
1. Unplug Pupil headset (if plugged in)
1. Restart your computer
1. Install drivers from step 2 in the `Install drivers for your Pupil headset` section
